# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Ouroboros is a self-developing AI agent that rewrites its own code, improves itself, and maintains persistent identity across restarts. It runs in Docker on a VPS, uses a data volume (`/data/`) for persistence, communicates via Telegram, and pushes changes to its own GitHub fork. Governed by a philosophical constitution (BIBLE.md) with 18 sections.

## Commands

```bash
make test        # Run smoke tests (pytest, ~134 tests, fast, no external deps)
make test-v      # Verbose test output
make test-e2e    # E2E tests in Docker (requires API keys in .env, runs real LLM)
make health      # Code complexity metrics
make clean       # Clean __pycache__, .pyc, .pytest_cache

# Run a single test
python3 -m pytest tests/test_smoke.py::test_name -v
```

## Linting

Ruff configured in `pyproject.toml`: line-length 120, Python 3.10+, rules E/F/W/I, E501 ignored.

## Architecture

Three-layer design:

**Layer 1 — Supervisor** (`supervisor/`): Process management, Telegram client, task queue, worker lifecycle, persistent state on data volume, git operations, event dispatch.

**Layer 2 — Agent Core** (`ouroboros/`): Per-worker agent instance. `agent.py` orchestrates message->context->tools. `loop.py` is the core LLM tool execution loop. `llm.py` is the sole OpenRouter API client. `context.py` assembles LLM context. `memory.py` manages scratchpad, identity, user context, and chat history. `consciousness.py` runs background thinking between tasks.

**Layer 3 — Tools** (`ouroboros/tools/`): Plugin registry with auto-discovery. Each module exports `get_tools()` returning `List[ToolEntry]`. `registry.py` is the SSOT — it collects all tools via `pkgutil.iter_modules()`. ~57 tools total. Every tool receives a `ToolContext` dataclass with repo dir, Drive root, task ID, event queue, browser state.

**Agent Skills** (`.agents/skills/`): Pre-packaged instruction sets in the open Agent Skills format (skills.sh). Stored in the repo, versioned in git. Progressive disclosure: Tier 1 catalog in LLM context, Tier 2 full instructions via `skill_activate`. The `find-skills` skill is pre-installed for discovering new skills.

**Entry points**: `launcher.py` -> `supervisor/workers.py` -> `ouroboros/agent.py` -> `ouroboros/loop.py`.

**Persistence**: All state lives on the data volume at `/data/` (JSON state files, JSONL event logs, markdown memory files). No database. Atomic writes with file locks. Agent Skills live in `.agents/skills/` in the repo (versioned in git).

## Key Conventions

- **SSOT pattern**: state.py owns state, llm.py owns API calls, registry.py owns tools. No duplicate definitions.
- **Minimalism (Bible section 8)**: Modules should fit in LLM context (~2000 lines). Methods >150 lines signal decomposition needed.
- **Versioning (Bible section 15)**: `VERSION` file == git tags == README changelog. Philosophy changes = MAJOR bump.
- **Tool auto-discovery**: Add a new tool by creating `ouroboros/tools/new_tool.py` with a `get_tools()` function. No registration code needed.
- **Agent Skills**: Pre-packaged instruction sets in `.agents/skills/` (skills.sh format). Install via `npx skills add`. Auto-discovered in LLM context.
- **BIBLE.md is the protected core** (Bible section 17): Cannot be deleted, gutted, or replaced wholesale. Changes require user approval and MAJOR version bump.
- **Self-improvements require user approval** unless `/no-approve` mode is active (Bible section 7).
- **Post-implementation checklist**: After implementing a change: (1) review your own work for mistakes, (2) check and update all documentation (`CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `IMPROVE.md`, `INSTALL.md`, `prompts/SYSTEM.md`, `.env.example`) to reflect the change. Documentation is a single source of truth — it may not cover everything, but what it says must be accurate.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md consistency**: `ARCHITECTURE.md` is the agent's technical self-knowledge (BIBLE.md §8). Keep it consistent with the actual code — update module descriptions, line counts, tool lists, and data flows when making structural changes.
